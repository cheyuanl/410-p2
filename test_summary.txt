actual_wait: Syscall, covers wait vanish fork yield set_status
             Not passed yet. It has a big buf, which may require
             auto stack growth.

agility_drill: mutex_lock and release. Require full thr_lib.
               Not test yet.

beady_test: Simple game for testing the thread lib. Require full thr_lib
            Not test yet.

bg: Not for p2. Syscall, covers fork exec. 
    Passed. Usage: bg getpid_test1.

bistromath: Test kernel with large ELF, Stack growth, simple threading.
            Not test yet.

cat: Syscall, cover readfile print.
     Passed. Usage: cat something.txt. The something.txt should be listed
     in the config.mk, and copied to the files directory.

cvar_test: Condition variables. Require full thr_lib.
           Not test yet.

cyclone: Basic thread behaviors with misbehaviors. Covers thr_create, 
         thr_join, thr_exit. 
         Not test yet.

excellent: A multi-threaded application which sometimes experiences

              Passed. Not suitable for misbehave.

halt_test: Syscall, test halt()
           Passed. Not suitable for misbehave.

idle, init, shell: Basic program for shell.

join_specific_test: Simple thread_lib test. This test spawns several 
                    threads and joins on some of them specifically. 
                    Others are joined on in a more general fashion.
                    Not test yet.

juggle: A tester in which threads juggle thread juggle threads.
        Not test yet.

largetest: Creates succesfully larger waves of threads until something 
           bad. Cover thr_create, thr_join. 
           Not test yet.

mandelbrot: Complicated test for thr_lib. Require everything.
            Not test yet.

multitest: Run multiple tests in one program.
           Not test yet.

mutex_destroy_test: Test for mutex_destroy(). Do not require thr_lib.
                    Will incur panic, because it destroy the mutex 
                    before unlock it. 
                    Passed.

nibbles: Syscall. Test console related syscall.
         Passed. The speed is too fast though.

paraguay: Condition variables. cond_wait, cond_signal. Require thr_yield.          
          Do not need thr_join. 
          Not test yet.

racer: Intensive test of Mutex, condition variable and semaphores.
       Not test yet.

rwlock_downgrade_read_test: test readers vs downgrading writers 
                            for rwlock.

         Passed all misbehave.

switzerland: Test whether the auto-stack survives thr_init()

               Not test yet.

wild_test1: Tests program death by unnatural causes. 
            Passed. Will trigger the Page fault and dump the reg values.
